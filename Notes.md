# To Do

* Remove unnecessary dependences:
  * Definitely scipy (used for sinc...)
  * Possibly matplotlib.
  
Issues
------
* Default config file in server directory.
  * Load this first, then read user's file.
* Don't fail if no config file exists, make one.
* Simple strategy for locating the config file: use the `__file__`
  variable.
 
  `os.path.dirname(__file__)`

* Choose better port - with some sort of resolution if it is used.

   ```bash
   # Set the NBPORT variable for the user from /etc/nbports
   export NBPORT=$(sed -n -e "s/${USER}: //p" /etc/nbports)
   if [ -z "$NBPORT" ]; then
      # https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/132524/37813
      export NBPORT=$(python - <<-END
           import socket
           s = socket.socket()
           s.bind(("", 0))
           print(s.getsockname()[1])
           s.close()
           END
   )
      >&2 echo "Warning: ${USER} not in /etc/nbports.  Using random port ${NBPORT}"
   fi
   ```

   Put a default port (not 8080) in config file, then search forward
   incrementally until a free port is found.
