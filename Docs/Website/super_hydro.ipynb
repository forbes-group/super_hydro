    "Nobel laureate Richard Feynman said: [\"I think I can safely say that nobody really understands quantum mechanics\"](https://cosmolearning.org/video-lectures/law-of-gravitation-an-example-of-physical-law-66-9944/).  Part of the reason is that quantum mechanics describes physical processes in a regime that is far removed from our every-day experience – namely, when particles are extremely cold and move so slowly that they behave more like waves than like particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This application attempts to help you develop an intuition for quantum behavior by exploiting the property that collections of extremely cold atoms behave as a fluid – a superfluid – whose dynamics can be explored in real-time.  By allowing you to interact and play with simulations of these superfluids, we hope you will have fun and develop an intuition for some of the new features present in quantum systems, taking one step closer to developing an intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond developing an intuition for quantum mechanics, this project provides an extensible and general framework for running interactive simulations capable of sufficiently high frame-rates for real-time interactions using high-performance computing techniques such as GPU acceleration.  The framework is easily extended to any application whose main interface is through a 2D density plot - including many fluid dynamical simulations.\n",

    "Because we interact with objects at room temperature, our intuition is based on the behavior of objects at this scale, which is well described by the laws of classical mechanics as formulated by Newton.  Our intuition starts to fail when we move away from this regime, either at speeds comparable to that of light, at which point Einstein's theory of relativity takes over and we must give up our notion of time moving at the same rate for everyone, or at very slow speeds where quantum mechanics takes over.\n",
    "\n",
    "This application takes advantage of a hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics that allows you to directly visualize and explore the behaviour of quantum fluids – superfluids – to develop an intuition for what happens in states of ultra-cold matter such as can be found in cold-atom laboratories around the world (such as the [Fundamental Quantum Physics Lab at WSU](https://labs.wsu.edu/engels/)), and in neutron stars, where the neutrons form a superfluid (cold compared to relevant nuclear scales)."
